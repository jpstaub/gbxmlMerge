Merge openings from one gbXML file to another gbXML file without openings.

# CADModelAzimuth
	-Nominal CADModelAzimuth is 0.
	-In Revit true north was shifted 45 degrees east of project north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit true north.
	-In Revit project north was shifted 90 degrees east of true north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit project north >> CADModelAzimuth is constant 0 >> gbXML coordinates change as required.

	-No need to generate new opening data >> exterior wall planes match due to Revit gbXML based on Dynamo.
	-'insert' preserves gbXML structure >> 'append' does not preserve gbXML structure.
	
# Revit gbXML >> Surface >> RectangularGeometry >> CartesianPoint
	-Designates centroid of the surface.
	
# Revit gbXML >> Surface >> Opening >> RectangularGeometry >> CartesianPoint
	-Third coordinate >> zero or missing.
	-Distance of the bottom-left corner of the opening to the bottom-left corner of the parent surface.
