# CADModelAzimuth
	-Nominal CADModelAzimuth is 0.
	-In Revit true north was shifted 45 degrees east of project north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit true north.
	-In Revit project north was shifted 90 degrees east of true north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit project north >> CADModelAzimuth is constant 0 >> gbXML coordinates change as required.
